Lately, I've been
I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been
I've been praying hard
Said, no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars

Yeah, we'll be counting stars

I see this life like a swinging vine
Swing my heart across the line
And in my face is flashing signs
Seek it out and ye' shall find

Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
On just doing what we're told
